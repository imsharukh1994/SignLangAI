## SignLangAI: Sign Language Detection Using AI

**SignLangAI** is an AI-based project aimed at detecting and recognizing sign language gestures in real-time. This project leverages deep learning techniques and custom datasets to build a robust model capable of interpreting various sign language gestures, making it an essential tool for communication among deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.

### Key Features:
- **Custom Dataset**: The project uses a personalized dataset that includes a wide variety of sign language gestures.
- **Real-Time Detection**: The model is designed for real-time sign language recognition using webcam input or pre-recorded video files.
- **AI Model**: The system is powered by advanced machine learning models trained to detect and classify different sign language gestures with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple interface to make it easy for users to interact with and test the system.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across different platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** for programming.
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for deep learning model implementation.
- **OpenCV** for real-time image and video processing.
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Flask** (if web interface is needed) or **Tkinter** for building GUI.
